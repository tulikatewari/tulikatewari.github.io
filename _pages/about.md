I‚Äôm a first-year doctoral researcher in the [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/)‚Äì[RMIT Melbourne](https://www.rmit.edu.au/) Collaborative PhD (cotutelle), jointly supervised by [Prof. Jagat Sesh Challa](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/jagat-sesh-challa/) and [Prof. Nalin Arachchilage](https://www.rmit.edu.au/profiles/g/nalin-arachchilage).

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a Junior Research Fellow (JRF) for a [SERB-SURE](https://anrfonline.in/ANRF/Sure) sponsored project at [Netaji Subhas University of Technology (NSUT), New Delhi](http://nsut.ac.in/en/home).  Under the guidance of [Dr. Gaurav Singal](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=475X_4QAAAAJ&view_op=list_works), I developed lightweight incremental and explainable intrusion detection systems for IoT ecosystem. Previously, I have also worked as an Intern at [Amazon](https://amazon.jobs/content/en/teams/transportation-shipping-logistics/wwrr) and as a Software Engineer at [Altran](https://www.capgemini.com/about-us/who-we-are/our-brands/capgemini-engineering/) (now Capgemini Engineering).
